* Welcome to Leisure!
- The Leisure project started around April, 2012

- It's a language and an environment

- Leisure is very much a work in progress

  - It is very operational, but a lot of parts are rough or naively implemented

  - Some parts have already gone through several iterations

  - it's slow (currently)
* Project Hieroglyph
  I have followed the dwindling of the space program with sadness, even bitterness.
  Where’s my orbiting, donut-shaped space station? Where’s my fleet of colossal
  Nova rockets? Where’s my ticket to Mars?...

  “You’re the ones who’ve been slacking off!” proclaimed Michael Crow, the President
  of Arizona State University, when I ran all of this by him later. He was referring,
  of course, to the science fiction writers. The scientists and engineers, he seemed
  to be saying, were ready, and looking for things to do. Time for the SF writers to
  start pulling their weight!

  -- Neal Stephenson

  Stephenson has put together a project to get write stories that are, "throwbacks, in
  a manner of speaking, to 1950′s-style SF, in that they would depict futures in which
  Big Stuff Got Done"
* A Crisis in the Field
- There's a crisis in the CS field

  ...current incoming students have grown up with video games and use
  iPhones daily.  Furthermore, they now arrive from high school with incredibly
  weak backgrounds.  We used to require calculus before beginning CS.  But now
  we don't require calculus at all! (Or we'd have no majors.)  When they see
  programming, even in very high-level languages, many incoming students recoil.
  They really enjoy *using* computers and may have even installed Windows, but
  they don't like building things...

  -- private communication from a prominent CS professor
* A Crisis in the Field
  - And yet, Minecraft is so popular...

  - People even build computers inside of Minecraft, like Nand To Tetris...
* A Crisis in the Field
#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src='talk/minecraftComputer.png' style='width: auto; height: 500px'>
#+END_HTML
* A Crisis in the Field
  - Programming for me is a lot like Minecraft

  - Can we help it be more like Minecraft for other people?
* Dynabook
  - Alan Kay's concept from 1972

    - This actually goes back to his research in the 60s

  "A personal computer for children of all ages"
  [[talk/dynabookPrototype.jpg]]

  - We already have machines powerful enough

  - Maybe a special type of document can provide what's missing...

  - It needs to be free and easy to use (no install, etc.)
* Dynabook
  - Neal Stephenson wrote a book called The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer

  - The primer is essentially a Dynabook
* Welcome to Leisure!
- Leisure is a */toy/* -- it's a bunch of stuff to play with

- A new environment (with some neat stuff)

- For kids!

- For grownups!

- Maybe even jaded, expert grownups...
* Back to the Dynabook
- We have the power to make the dynabook, but it's still not here...

- What if we made special documents that were dynabooks?

  - Documents don't have to cost money

- What if each document was like its own computer?

  - Documents can contain media

  - Versioning can provide state

- What if the document's source was part of the document itself

  - End-user multimedia document

  - Interactive

  - Annotated source code (maybe hidden by default)

  - Editable at runtime
* Document-centric computing
- These concepts aren't /that/ new, they just haven't been that accessible to people, lately

- Smalltalk -- a smalltalk image is almost a document (not really linear)

- Hypercard

- EMACS (file-local variables, orgmode)

- Oberon (Acme, Wily, Ober)

- Tiddlywiki (almost a JavaScript/HTML version of hypercard)

- Scala workspaces
* Document-centric computing
- The Mathematica and IPython Notebook environments are probably the closest things to the Leisure environment out there

- Mathematica is far from free

- [[http://ipython.org/notebook.html][IPython Notebook]] is a notebook for Python -- very cool project
* Document-centric computing
- HTML5 really has a lot of promise for this!

- HTML is made for documents (uh... duh?)

- You can edit HTML in a browser

- HTML documents can present a lot of different types of media

- Web services can fill in the blanks (one in particular :) )
* Computing education
- Fun is important

- Promote building

  - Documents are not just source files

  - Document can embed media

  - Promote pride of ownership

  - Each document is like a tiny computer -- mod it!
* Can we improve human and computer communication and understanding?


  - REPLs are good, but they are mostly read-only

    - Except for the line at the bottom

  - What if you could embed runnable examples directly in the source?

  - Interact with the program directly through the source code?

  - Watch expressions are good

    - But they usually work better in debuggers than in REPLs

    - In fact, they're very close to test cases, in a way...

  - Interact with the *author* directly through the source code?

* Can we improve human and computer communication and understanding?

Try firstTwo out, below!
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic

#+END_SRC
* Computing Education
  - Leisure hooks up to Github

    - Document storage

    - Connects programmers together

      - You see their comments

      - You can comment on their code

      - Check out my blog post for [[http://this-statement-is-false.blogspot.com/2011/12/code-google.html][more stuff]]
* Computing Education
  - With better understanding, people might actually reuse code when they see it

    - Instead of throwing up their hands and rewriting it
* Computing Education
  - Promote exploration -- peeking under the hood

    - View ASTs

    - Dynamic expression results update as you type

    - Dynamic test cases update as you type

    - Partially applied functions can make sense

- They're completely first-class (parameters are accessable)

- By the way, the display code for partially applied functions is just a Leisure function
* Back to Documents
- Orgmode is a fantastic EMACS tool

- It's just */text/*, but it represents /very/ rich documents that are more than just nice looking

  - Outline format, tags, properties, code, html, tables, data, ...

- Leisure supports a growing subset: lorg files

- JavaScript orgMode parser is a separate open source project
* Lorg files
- Tags for visibility, categories

- Leisure functions inherit block name and tags

** Subpoint :tag1:tag2:
#+NAME: propertyExample
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
propertyExampleFunc x = x

getProperties propertyExampleFunc
#+END_SRC
* Lorg files
- Lorg files can store data in their own documents

  - A lorg file can act to some extent like a Smalltalk image

  - Remote lorg files fit well with the web

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results static
newCodeContent 'dataBlock' concat['data = ' {'height':11 'weight':721 'temperature':63}]
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: dataBlock
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results def
data = {'height':5 'weight':6 'temperature':512}
#+END_SRC

- Docs can run code when loaded (old EMACS trick)
* Of course
This presentation is a lorg file
* Of course
Leisure can present a lorg file in different ways

- Slides

- Plain

- Fancy
* The Leisure Environment Q&A
...
* The Language
- Leisure compiles to Javascript

- It's a naive compiler

- There's a lot of room for improvement!
* The Language: Minimizes parentheses
- Each indented line adds a group to the overhanging expression

- Grouping still works, though

#+END_HTML

- [ is a macro and '[' and ']' make groups
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
indentation = [
  [1 2]
  [3 4]]

#+END_SRC
* The Language: Minimizes parentheses
- Macros rewrite their expressions at compile time, like in Clojure (Lisp)

- Macros can do varargs, which isn't so easy in pure Lambda Calculus

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
f4 = concat[1 2 3]
f4
#+END_SRC

  a = x
  b = dbl y
  y < 0
    a

#+END_SRC
* The Language: Partial application
- It's like Lambda Calculus

- And Haskell

(Except that it's dynamically typed and it can display partial applications) :)
* The Language: Partial application
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
cons 1 nil
cons 1
3 + 2
3 +
[(3+) (cons 1) 57]
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Partial application
You can access partially applied functions' parameters

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
getType (cons 1)

funcInfo (cons [1])
head (head (tail (funcInfo (cons [1]))))
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Metaprogramming
- Basic parsing can define tokens and groups

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
[1 2 3]
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Metaprogramming
- Macros rewrite expressions (input and output is a list)

  - Not hygienic, yet

- Combining groups with macros can work like varargs

[ ... ]
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
ex1 = [1 2 3]
#+END_SRC

concat[ ... ]
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
ex2 = concat[1 2 3]
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Metaprogramming
- Do (a lot like Haskell's do) is a macro

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
do
  x = 1
  y = 2
  x + y
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Metaprogramming
- Parse filters are like macros, but an active parse filter processes */all/* code

- Infix is implemented in Leisure as a parse filter

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
[1 2 + 3 4]
#+END_SRC

- Parse filters are only active within a given file

- Each file can specify which parse filters it uses

- Parse filters can be activated/deactivated at any point in a file

- This works because defining a term in Leisure is monadic
* The Language: Homoiconic

- Streams, etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
increasing x = [x | (increasing x + 1)]
naturals = increasing 1
even? x = x % 2 == 0
take 5 (filter even? (map (\x . x + 10) naturals))
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Data Types
- Any function which only returns a lambda places a data type with its name on the lambda
#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
getType [1]
person name addr = \f . f name addr
getType (person 'bob' '123 Maple St')
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Function advice
An easy way to handle defaults and extensions

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results def
person name addr = \f . f name addr

defaultName x = 'Default'
defCase defaultName.person p | hasType p person -> p \n a . n
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
defaultName 3
defaultName (person 'bob' '123 Maple St')
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Function properties
- Functions can be declared with key-value properties

- Type assertions

- Alternate behavior for known types (like pretty-printing association lists)

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
{'a':1 'b':2}
getType {'a':1 'b':2}
getProperties {'a':1 'b':2}
head {'a':1 'b':2}
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Monads
- Expression output box is part of monad's "environment"

#+BEGIN_SRC leisure :results dynamic
do
    x <- prompt "What is your name?"
    print concat["Hello, " x]
#+END_SRC
* The Language: Monads
- Code that runs at load-time can use monads to affect the Leisure environment

- Import is monadic

- Parser directives are monadic

- Monads can affect the notebook environment

- Setting themes

- Turning autotests on or off
* Future: Pattern matching
- Structural patterns, like in Haskell

  last [x] = x
  last [x | y] = last y

  equal x y = eq x y
  equal [h1 | t1] [h2 | t2] = and
    equal h1 h2
    equal t1 t2

  find key [] = none
  find key [key value | rest] = some value
  find key [\_ \_ | rest] = find key rest

  getName (person {name: n}) = n

- Uses function advice

- Can make a dispatch table based on data type
* Future: Debugging
- Support specific to lazy evaluation is in the works

- Some omniscient debugging techniques

- Two stack traces for an error

  - Stack trace of where a value was created

  - Stack trace of where a value was requested
